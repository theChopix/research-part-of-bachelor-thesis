    <h2>Research Documentation</h2>
    <p>This documentation offers a brief overview of visualization methods in the form of existing libraries, which were
      presented and taken into account before the creation of the application itself.

      For more detailed information, it is possible to view (and run) the jupyter notebooks themselves in individual
      directories of python-based libraries. The most detailed and theoretical overview with comments is given in the
      written part of the bachelor's thesis.
      <br><br>
      Images of individual visualizations in this documentation
      often do not directly relate to the model provided by seznam.cz due to
      incompatibility with catboost. in some cases [scikit-based] a new model is trained with validation data provided
      by seznam.cz to demonstrate the visualization. Elsewhere, due to the specificity of the method, the model is
      trained on completely different data given in the documentation of the library itself [pybaobabdt].

    <h4>Content</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>catboost-native</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The library that is used to create the model provides itself visualization function which captures the
          structure of decision trees in model. This is the baseline method that is now most used in practice and which
          can then be compared with the proposed solution.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>scikit-based</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the most popular machine-learning libraries offers decision tree visualization methods, but due to
          differences in model implementation, they are not compatible with catboost models. This section also describes
          the dtreeviz library for more detailed visualizations that are compatible with scikit-learn models.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>js-based</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>A javascript library for creating interactive visualizations was also taken into consideration. Due to the
          complexity of the implementation that this visualization method required, the implementation in the form of a
          small application was removed from the documentation. Demonstration pictures are available for viewing.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>sankey</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The method and library, which is ultimately used in the application itself, after customization offers a
          view of the
          flow of data passing through the structure of the model.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>baobabdt</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>This library provides a view of the data flows passing through the model along with the model structure
          itself for scikit models. This is an existing technique that most closely resembles the proposed solution.
